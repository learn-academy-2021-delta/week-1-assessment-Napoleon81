# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a system that helps us manage, track and locate open projects in repositories inside GitHub, a cloud based host.

  Researched answer: Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: true and false

  Researched answer: a binary variable, having two possible values called “true” and “false.”



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An Index is the location or address of an assigned variable or character. Value is the data type contained in a variable.

  Researched answer:
  An index is a numerical representation of an item's position in a sequence. This sequence can refer to many things: a list, a string of characters, or any arbitrary sequence of values. In some programming languages, an array can be defined by key-value pairs, where a specific key points to a value.


4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: A Built-in Method is a pre-programmed function in a coding language or application that is accessible to programmers.

  Researched answer:A function that is built into an application and can be accessed by users.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:Proper Pair Programing techniques allow two programmers to share the responsibility of the coding process such as switching in a timely manner the roles of navigating, which consists of dictating, researching and looking over the code for errors while the driver inputs the code.
  Researched answer:s Pomodoro a pairing technique that forces developers to split their work time into smaller units. The units of work consist of 25-minute-long sessions with 5-minute breaks in between, and a longer 20-minute break after every 4 sessions.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: pair programming



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration:The repeated execution of some groups of code statements in a program is called iteration.

2. Higher Order Functions:Functions that take a function as an argument

3. Jest: testing framework

4. Objects: data types with a key value pairs

5. Classes:template for creating objects , providing value and implement behavior
